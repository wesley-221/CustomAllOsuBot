# Setting up the config file
If you want to make this bot to work, you have to create a new file (and the folder): `/configfiles/config.json`.
This file should contain the following information:

```
{
	"botToken": "",
	"ids": {
		"botId": "294492232407580672",
		"masterUser": "88662320791707648"
	},
	"port": 8080
}
```
